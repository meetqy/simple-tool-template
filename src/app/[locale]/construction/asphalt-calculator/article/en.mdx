## Key Features of Our Asphalt Calculator

Our Asphalt Calculator is designed with simplicity and accuracy in mind. Here's what makes it stand out:

### 1. Unit System Options

- **Imperial System:** Measure in inches (in), feet (ft), or yards (yd) and weight in pounds (lbs) or tons.
- **Metric System:** Measure in centimeters (cm) or meters (m) and weight in kilograms (kg) or tonnes.

### 2. Flexible Input Fields

- **Width:** Input the width of your paving area and select your preferred unit.
- **Length:** Specify the length of the area to be paved, choosing the desired unit.
- **Depth:** Enter the depth or thickness of the asphalt layer and select its unit.
- **Price per Ton (Optional):** Add the cost of asphalt per ton to estimate your project's budget.

### 3. Clear and Detailed Results

- **Hotmix Asphalt Required:** Displays the volume in both cubic yards and cubic feet (or metric equivalents).
- **Asphalt Weight:** Provides the total weight in tons and pounds (or metric equivalents).
- **Cost Estimation (if price is provided):** Calculates the total cost based on the weight and price per ton.

## Example Calculation

Let’s assume you are paving a driveway measuring **12 ft wide**, **24 ft long**, and **2 inches deep**, with asphalt priced at **$100 per ton**.

- **Hotmix Asphalt Required:** 0.444 cubic yards (12 ft³)
- **Asphalt Weight:** 0.87 tons (1,740 lbs)
- **Cost Estimation:** $87 (0.87 tons × $100/ton)

This calculator ensures accurate estimates for smooth project execution.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### 1. How does the Asphalt Calculator determine weight?

The weight is calculated using the standard density of hotmix asphalt, approximately **145 lbs per cubic foot** (2,320 kg/m³). Adjustments can be made for different mixes.

### 2. Can I use this calculator for both small and large projects?

Absolutely! Whether you’re paving a small driveway or a large parking lot, the calculator accommodates all project sizes.

### 3. How do I measure the depth of the asphalt layer?

Measure the compacted thickness of the asphalt layer. For driveways, a depth of 2–3 inches is typical, while roads may require 4–6 inches.

### 4. Why is the price per ton optional?

Including the price per ton is optional to provide flexibility. If you're unsure of the cost, the calculator still provides accurate material volume and weight estimates.

### 5. Can I switch between Imperial and Metric units?

Yes, the calculator allows seamless switching between unit systems to suit your preferences or project specifications.
