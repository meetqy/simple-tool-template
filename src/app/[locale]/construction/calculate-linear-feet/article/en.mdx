# How to Calculate Linear Feet

## What is Linear Feet?

A **linear foot** is a measurement of length in feet. It is used to measure the length of an object in a straight line. Linear feet are commonly used in construction, carpentry, and other fields where the length of materials is important. Unlike square feet, which measure area, linear feet measure only length.

## How to Calculate Linear Feet?

To calculate linear feet, you need to know the width of the material in inches and the total area in square feet. The formula to calculate linear feet is:

```plaintext
Linear Feet = (Square Feet * 12) / Width (in inches)
```

### Example

Suppose you have a material that is 6 inches wide and covers an area of 120 square feet. Using the formula:

```plaintext
Linear Feet = (120 * 12) / 6 = 240 linear feet
```

## Using the Linear Feet Calculator: An Example

Our **Linear Feet Calculator** simplifies this process. Here's how you can use it:

1. **Width (inches)**: Enter the width of the material in inches.
2. **Square Feet**: Enter the total area in square feet.
3. **Calculate**: Click the "Calculate" button to see the total linear feet.
4. **Results**: The results will display the calculated linear feet.

### Example

Suppose you have a material that is 8 inches wide and covers an area of 96 square feet. Using the formula:

```plaintext
Linear Feet = (96 * 12) / 8 = 144 linear feet
```

Using our tool, you would input these values and click "Calculate" to get the same result.
